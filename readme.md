    - `fitparse` for parsing FIT files
    -  `Pillow` (PIL fork) for image processing
    - `moviepy` for creating video files
    - `numpy` for handling image data
    - `gradio` for GUI client

You can install the required packages with the following command

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```bash
pip install fitparse pillow moviepy numpy gradio
```

whatever works.
